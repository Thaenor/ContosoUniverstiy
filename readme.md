#Contoso University ASP.NET exercise#

This project is originally from Microsoft's tutorial on the MVC pattern using Visual Studio 2013, Entity Framework 6, and MVC 5.
I am just rewritting it as a study method to learn more in the context of web applications.

The tutorial can be seen [Here](http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/older-versions/getting-started-with-ef-5-using-mvc-4/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application).

The goal of this repo is to serve as a reference point for me (and hopefully others) to the creation of web applications using the Model Views Controller pattern.
